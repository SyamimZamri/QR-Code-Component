## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid layout 


### What I learned

- Accesibility issues:
  - Learned how to use semantic HTML tags correctly
      Example: main, footer
  - Page has to contain a level-one header when using main tag
- How to center components dynamically using Grid layout
  - Not needing to use margin  
- Styling box component using box-sizing and box-shadow properties 
- Being introduced to HSL values 
  
  
### Continued development

To learn more about CSS Grid and Flexbox implementation.


### Useful resources

- [Semantic HTML](https://laylacodes.hashnode.dev/what-is-semantic-html) - This helped me to understand how to use semantic HTML correctly. 
- [Guide to Centering in CSS](https://moderncss.dev/resource-the-complete-guide-to-centering-in-css/) - This is a thorough article which helped me to understand how to center elements using CSS. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
